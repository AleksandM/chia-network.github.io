title: "When will Chia launch mainnet?"
---

We will launch mainnet as soon as itâ€™s done and are currently planning to launch **on or before March 17, 2021**. Software development is notoriously difficult to predict and the Chia blockchain and Chialisp are the first applied versions of a number of new discoveries in cryptography and computer science. Keep up to date here on our website, on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/chia_network.public), on [Github](https://github.com/Chia-Network/), on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/ZuNx7sET/engineering-core), and on our mailing list as we continue to release open source software and updates regarding our release plans. Updated [release timing](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/FAQ#when-mainnet) is usually available first in the [Repository FAQ](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/FAQ).
