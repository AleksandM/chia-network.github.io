Chia has a novel business model to both lower volatility of the coin and increase adoption. It lowers volatility by allowing us to loan Chia and manage the interest rates of those loans as well as other tools. To drive adoption, we are going to loan Chia to Global 5000 companies who will use it to pay their international vendors less expensively, quickly, and more secure.
