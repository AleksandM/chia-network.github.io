title: "When will Chia launch Mainnet?"
---

We hope to launch Mainnet as soon as it's done. Software development is difficult to predict beforehand as it's often over budget and behind schedule. Keep up to date here on our website, on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/chia_network.public), and on our [mailing list](https://www.chia.net/community/) as we continue to release open source software and updates regarding our IPO plans.
