title: "When will Chia launch Mainnet?"
---

We hope to launch Mainnet as soon as itâ€™s done and we are currently targeting to finish at the end of 2020. Software development is notoriously difficult to predict and the Chia blockchain and Chialisp are the first applied versions of a number of new discoveries in cryptography and computer science. Keep up to date here on our website, on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/chia_network.public), on [Github](https://github.com/Chia-Network/), on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/ZuNx7sET/engineering-core), and on our mailing list as we continue to release open source software and updates regarding our release plans. Updated [release timing](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/FAQ#when-mainnet) is available in the [Repository FAQ](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/FAQ).
