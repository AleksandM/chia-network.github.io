title: "Is the value of Chia going to be volatile?"
---

We believe that Chia coins will be less volatile than other cryptocurrencies due to the nature of our planned public company status which will allow financial institutions to hedge and leverage coins and equity and our ability to use the Chia Strategic Reserve to reduce volatility in the Chia in the market.
