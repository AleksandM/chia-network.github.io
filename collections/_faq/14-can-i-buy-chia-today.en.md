title: "Can I buy Chia today?"

No. Once mainnet launches, we anticipate a multi-week period where only farming rewards are distributed by the network and transactions will not yet be allowed. This is to provide for a period to help stabilize the amount of space allocated to the Chia blockchain and to prioritize our space farmers. Additionally, release candidate farming software will be able to generate plots that will be immediately farmable on both testnet and mainnet at launch.  Chia is likely to be available on most global exchanges shortly after transactions begin on the mainnet.
