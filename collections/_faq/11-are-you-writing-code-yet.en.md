Are you writing code yet?
-----------------------

Yes, while we are making a huge effort to architect the blockchain securely, we have already released a [BLS Signature library](https://github.com/Chia-Network/bls-signatures), a [VDF/Proof of Time](https://github.com/Chia-Network/vdf-competition) implementation, and a [Proof of Space](https://github.com/Chia-Network/proofofspace) implementation. BLS Signatures allow for better custody and control of transactions on the blockchain, and POT and POS are both critical to our consensus algorithm.
