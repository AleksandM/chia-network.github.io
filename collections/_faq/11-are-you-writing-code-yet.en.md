Are you writing code yet?
-----------------------

Yes. While we are spending tons of time and effort to architect it securely we have already released a [BLS Signature library](https://github.com/Chia-Network/bls-signatures) and a [VDF/Proof of Time](https://github.com/Chia-Network/vdf-competition) implementation. BLS Signatures allow better custody and control of transactions on the blockchain. POT is critical to our consensus algorithm.
