title: "What is Chia’s inflation?"
---

After the Chia pre-farm, Chia will offer farming rewards of 16 chia every 5 minutes. Over the first 15 years the farming rewards will be halved at the end of each 5th year. From year 16 to infinity, the rewards will remain constant at 2 chia every 5 minutes leading to ever decreasing inflation rates. Chia’s inflation falls through the 0.50% rate 42 years after mainnet launch.
