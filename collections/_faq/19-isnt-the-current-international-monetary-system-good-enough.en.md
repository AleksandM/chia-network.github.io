No. Around the world, governments and banks cause problematic interactions that make banks difficult to trust, especially in volatile regions like Hong Kong, Venezuela Argentina or Lebanon.

CitiBank often charges up to 3% spreads and there are a few other banks in more than a couple countries. International wire fraud losses are very large, and we have a better solution to mitigate these problems.
