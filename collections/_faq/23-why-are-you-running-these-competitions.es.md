title: "Why are you running these competitions?"

We believe that more eyes on our code will only make it better. For example, the [results of our VDF Competition](https://www.chia.net/2019/01/17/chia-vdf-competition-round-1-results-and-announcements.en.html) produced a VDF implementation whose runtime was 80% faster than our original implementation.
