Isn’t the current international monetary system good enough? 
-----------------------

No. It’s expensive, slow and antiquated. International payments are slow, expensive and insecure. International SWIFT wires take 1-5 days. CitiBank often charges up to 3% spreads and few other banks are in more than 1-2 countries. International wire fraud losses are very large.
