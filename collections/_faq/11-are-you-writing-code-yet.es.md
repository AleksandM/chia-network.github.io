-----------------------

Yes, while we are making a huge effort to architect the blockchain securely, we have already released a [BLS Signature library](https://github.com/Chia-Network/bls-signatures) and a [VDF/Proof of Time](https://github.com/Chia-Network/vdf-competition) implementation. BLS Signatures allow better custody and control of transactions on the blockchain. POT is critical to our consensus algorithm.
