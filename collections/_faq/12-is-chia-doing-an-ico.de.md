Is Chia doing an ICO?
-----------------------

No. Chia is not planning an ICO. Instead, our goal is to take the company public on an American stock market. This way, shareholders can share risk and return with management with transparency and disclosure. The Chia digital money is meant to be a useful payment instrument and not an investment opportunity. Chia intends to complete a fully compliant SEC registered equity IPO and will come to market as market-timing is amenable.
