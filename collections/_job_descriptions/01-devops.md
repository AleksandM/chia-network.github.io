title: "DevOps Engineer"
---

Chia Network is looking for a DevOps engineer to continue to automate, secure, and streamline current and future deployments for Chia's testnet and fast approaching mainnet launch. In addition, our DevOps engineer will also be responsible for monitoring all of these services, running and deploying our [Timelords](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/Network-Architecture#timelords) globally, and supporting infrastructure for development, QA, and testnets. You'll be taking on DevOps from and with our President and will be reviewing our current infrastructure with the best tools in mind such as Kubnernetes, and Docker. Prior experience with deployments on AWS, GitHub Actions, comfort with Windows, Linux, and MacOS on x64 and ARM64, and secure key management infrastructure is desired. This position will also entail some IT troubleshooting as well as supporting Chia's internal security and custody solutions in a high threat environment in Europe, the Caribbean, North America, and Asia. Working remotely is ok but there is a strong preference for you being in a North American timezone most of your working hours.

One of the great things about supporting a decentralized blockchain is that it's not a 4 9's kind of job since our farmers run the massively fault tolerant things for us. We're also going to get to play with some very fun toys like TB RAM plotting servers and the fastest single core [VDFs](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/10/12/introduction-to-verifiable-delay-functions-vdfs/) and later ASICs (will we need nitrogen cooling?) to run the fastest [Timelords](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/Network-Architecture#timelords) on the planet.

DevOps Engineer Responsibilities:
- Support and maintain development, build, and test infrastructure.
- Begin hardening dependency trees and plan for and execute securely repeatable builds on Window, MacOS and Linux.
- Maintain network security while providing ease of use for development and QA.
- Begin to add additional automated QA and testing.
- Maintain GitHub source repositories and manage Python setuptools, PyPI and pip integration between them.
- Support various SaaS integrations and information tools like the website and documentation sites.

DevOps Engineer Requirements:
- Bachelorâ€™s degree (or equivalent experience) in Computer Science, IT, or a similar field.
- Previous experience in a security focused environment.
- In-depth knowledge of Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
- Experience with AWS.
- Python, shell, and C++ are our core development environments and competence with at least one is required.
- Excellent troubleshooting skills.
