               Chia is based upon an innovative new consensus algorithm, <a href="/faq/#faq-3">Proof of Space and Time</a>, that leverages the strengths of Lisp programming to address technology limitations and energy constraints faced today.     
            </p>
            <p>
                Proof of Space is a cryptographic technique where provers show that they allocate unused hard drive space for storage space. In order to be used as a consensus method, Proof of Space must be tied to Proof of Time (PoT). PoT ensures that block times have consistency in the time between them and increases the overall security of the blockchain. Learn more about PoST in the <a href="/greenpaper">Chia Green Paper</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Compared to proof of work blockchains, Chia is less energy intensive and more versatile. Compared to proofs of stake, Chia is more efficient and less vulnerable to attack or manipulation. Chia delivers the security and safety of Bitcoin along with the functional benefits of Ethereum 2.0.
