    Chia is useful, sustainable, and accessible currency for a new age of digital money. We’ve designed a blockchain network that&apos;s more secure, more geographically dispersed, and less wasteful than traditional cryptocurrencies, making it more compatible for both personal and professional needs. Chia was founded in 2017 in San Francisco by a team rooted in digital money, cryptography, and finance sectors, coming from BitTorrent, Tradehill, Changetip, Lightning Labs, Stanford University, and Columbia University.

    En 2018, Chia réalisera le premier IPO conforme à la réglementation A+ dans le domaine de la monnaie numérique. Pourquoi? Parce qu'une monnaie numérique utile, durable et accessible doit être exploitée avec la transparence et la responsabilité attendues d'une société ouverte.

    Chia est une monnaie utile, durable et accessible pour une nouvelle ère de monnaie numérique. Nous avons conçu un réseau de chaînes de blocs plus sécurisé, plus dispersé géographiquement et moins onéreux que les crypto-monnaies traditionnelles, ce qui le rend plus compatible pour les besoins personnels et professionnels. Chia a été fondée en 2017 à San Francisco par une équipe basée dans les secteurs de la monnaie numérique, de la cryptographie et de la finance, issue de BitTorrent, Tradehill, Changetip, Lightning Labs, l'Université de Stanford et l'Université de Columbia.

    Chia is useful, sustainable, and accessible currency for a new age of digital money. We’ve designed a blockchain network that&apos;s more secure, more geographically dispersed, and less wasteful than traditional cryptocurrencies, making it more compatible for both personal and professional needs. Chia was founded in 2017 in San Francisco by a team rooted in digital money, cryptography, and finance sectors, coming from BitTorrent, Tradehill, Changetip, Lightning Labs, Stanford University, and Columbia University.
