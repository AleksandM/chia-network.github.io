    Chia’s Alpha Testnet
    --------------------

    Chia Network is a new eco-friendly cryptocurrency and smart transaction platform created by the founder of BitTorrent, [Bram Cohen](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/chia-vs-bitcoin/). It is inspired and similar to the Bitcoin blockchain, but in Chia, the resource is not computing power, but disk space. To achieve this the energy intensive “proofs of work” are replaced by “proofs of space”, so disk-space becomes the main resource for validating transactions not energy. 

    Alpha testnet introduces the first version of Chialisp, Chia’s smart transaction programming language. The smart transactions currently available are: [atomic swaps](https://github.com/Chia-Network/wallets/blob/master/docs/atomic_swaps.md), [authorized payees](https://github.com/Chia-Network/wallets/blob/master/docs/authorised_payees.md), [recoverable wallets](https://github.com/Chia-Network/wallets/blob/master/docs/recoverable_wallet.md), [multisig wallets](https://github.com/Chia-Network/wallets/blob/master/multisig/README.org), and [rate-limited wallets](https://github.com/Chia-Network/wallets/blob/master/docs/rate_limited_wallet.md). The founder of Chia Network, and former founder of BitTorrent, has more on [Chialisp](https://www.chia.net/2019/11/27/chialisp.en.html). 

    Alpha testnet also introduces Chia’s blockchain consensus layer which includes a full node, farmer and timelord. The blockchain is alpha and does not yet support transactions. Here are some additional thoughts on the [alpha blockchain](https://www.chia.net/2019/11/26/alpha-release.en.html). 

    Since this is an alpha release, you may want to review the [release errata](https://www.chia.net/releases).

    Blockchain
    ----------

    Chia’s blockchain includes a full node, farmer, and timelord. Download the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain).

    Chialisp and LedgerSim
    ----------------------

    LedgerSim supports Chialisp smart transactions on a ledger instead of a blockchain for testing and development purposes. Chia’s wallets showcase our new programming language, Chialisp. Download the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Chia-Network/wallets).

    Chia Network is a decentralized open source global blockchain which is less wasteful, more decentralized, and more secure than traditional proof of work cryptocurrencies. It is inspired and similar to the Bitcoin blockchain, but in Chia, the resource is not computing power, but disk space. To achieve this, the “proofs of work” used in Bitcoin are replaced by “proofs of space”, so disk-space becomes the main resource and proofs of time to come to a decentralized “Nakamoto-style” consensus that validates transactions.

    Chia network is also a smart transaction platform company.
  about_team_title: "Team"
  about_team_description: |
    Chia Network was founded by the creator of BitTorrent, [Bram Cohen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cohenbram/). It also includes executive leadership from the former acting-CEO of overstock.com, [Mitch Edwards](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchelledwards/) and a former founder of eMusic.com and Vindicia, [Gene Hoffman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gehoffman/). Chia Network will have a large open source developer community with many causal contributions to the codebase. There are many more who contribute to research, peer review, testing, documentation, and translation.

    The Green Paper details a new consensus algorithm called Proofs of Space and Time, “PoST”. PoST replaces the proofs of work in Bitcoin’s mining which wastes massive amounts of energy and is less secure to to mining centralization.

    We have academic papers and presentations that give detail about our new consensus algorithm and blockchain software. In 2019 we revealed our [Green Paper](https://www.chia.net/assets/ChiaGreenPaper.pdf) outlining the construction of Proofs of Space and Time and illustrating many of the design choices of Chia. There is also a [2019 talk from Mariano Sorgente](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_075bzQPooU) at MIT on how to achieve Nakamoto consensus with Proof of Space and VDFs.

    Bram Cohen [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zlcgt8FVz4) at Stanford on February 2018 on Proofs of Space. Our advisors, Dan Boneh, Benedikt Bünz, and Ben Fisch [published a survey of VDFs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/712.pdf) which are the underlying technology of Proof of Time. Lipa Long [published an explanation of class groups](https://github.com/Chia-Network/vdf-competition/blob/master/classgroups.pdf) that our [Proofs of Time](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/627.pdf) is based on. Bram presented [Beyond Hellman’s Time-Memory Trade-Offs with Applications to Proofs of Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqxkO7C-cyk) at BPASE ‘18 in January 2018 based on the [academic paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/893) and these [slides](https://view.publitas.com/chia-network/pbase18slides/page/1) by Hamza Abusalah. Ben Fisch gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUoagL7OZ1k) at BPASE 2018 in January 2018 on Verifiable Delay Functions. Bram [spoke at Blockchain at Berkeley](https://www.facebook.com/BlockchainatBerkeley/videos/2006069823011271/) (which starts about 20:00) in March 2018 with [slides](https://cyber.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj9936/f/bramcohen.pdf). Bram gave a [talk at BPASE 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYG0NxoG7yw) in January 2017 on removing waste with Proofs of Space and Time ([slides](https://cyber.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj9936/f/bramcohen.pdf)).

    Bram gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZaB4hM8SQ4) at SF Bitcoin Devs Seminar about data structures for scaling Bitcoin with [slides](https://view.publitas.com/chia-network/bitcoin_data_structures/) and [Merkle Set code](https://github.com/bramcohen/MerkleSet). Bram gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZaB4hM8SQ4) at SF Bitcoin Devs Seminar about removing waste from cryptocurrencies.

    body_section_1:
      heading: "The VDF Challenge"
      paragraph_1: "A few months ago we wrapped up our initial VDF implementation competition and were amazed by the excellent quality of the submissions.  The top three contenders each came in at under one minute (the reference implementation was 169 seconds).  Five other teams also submitted implementations which were faster than the reference.  All of the submissions were open-source, and can be found [here](https://www.chia.net/2019/07/18/chia-vdf-competition-round-2-results-and-announcements.en.html).  The award total was originally $100,000, but because of the hard work that ll the teams put into the competition, we decided to award $2,000 to each team who submitted an entry, bringing the total prize money awarded to $116,000."
      paragraph_2: "We are proud to announce a second competition, challenging entrants to improve on our new reference implementation."
    body_section_2:
      heading: "Two Tracks"
      line_1: "The second VDF competition will be split into two tracks:"
      line_2: "1. SIMD and GPU optimization allowed"
      line_3: "2. SIMD and GPU optimization not allowed"
      paragraph: "This is to help us separate the different kinds of optimization. We expect that the entries which use the optimizations allowed in track 1 will be faster, however there is no requirement for track 1 submission to use those techniques. This means that all track 2 submissions are also eligible for submissions to track 1. The winners of each track will receive $50,000. Individuals and teams are invited to join. Entrants will all have access to the specialized computers in Chia’s laboratory. Specifications of the reference hardware and further technical details are available on our GitHub. You can view our pre-commitment [here](https://github.com/Chia-Network/vdf-competition). Contestants will be able to communicate with Chia during the competition via a secure Keybase channel."
